 public cloud uses shared infrastructure hosted by a third-party provider, offering high scalability and a pay-as-you-go model with lower upfront costs. 

A private cloud uses dedicated infrastructure for a single organization, providing enhanced security, control, and customization but requiring higher initial investment and potentially limited scalability based on hardware. 
The choice depends on an organization's needs for security, compliance, cost, and flexibility.
